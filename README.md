# Welcome to Cameron
## A Simple Framework for Simple Apps

Cameron is a lightweight framework for building simple HTML/JS/CSS apps (that maybe even have an
API). If you want to get something online that has some simple interactivity, forms and even an API,
but don't want to go full-blown React then you've come to the right place.

You write HTML, CSS and Javascript and Cameron will generate plain ol' HTML files for serving
however you like. If you want to deploy your site to Netlify then you can also submit forms, add
signup/login and even provide an API all without worrying about any server setup or infrastructure.

Although you can structure your code any way you want, Cameron provides some sensible defaults:

* We like StimulusJS for
adding Javascript interactivity to our pages without the overhead and baggage of something like
jQuery. As the Stimulus Handbook says, it is "designed to augment your HTML with just enough
behavior to make it shine."
* We like Tailwind CSS because, as they say, it "provides low-level utility classes that let you
build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML."
* We like Netlify because you can deploy your code in seconds and lets you work with serverless
functions without managing them yourself.
